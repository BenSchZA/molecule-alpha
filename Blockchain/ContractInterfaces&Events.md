```
emits `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);`

---

```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) external returns (bool);
```
emits `Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);`

---

##### Price To Mint

```

---

##### Withdraw
Allows a creator to withdraw a specific rounds funds
```
function withdraw(uint256 _phase) external returns(bool);
```
emits `FundingWithdrawn(uint256 phase, uint256 amount);`

---

##### Validate Funding
 Verifies that the phase passed in: has not been withdrawn, funding goal has been reached, and that the phase has not expired. Notice: Only emits phase finalize once the final phase has been finalized this function can only be called by the market, and is called when someone buys tokens. 
```
function validateFunding() external returns(bool);
```
emits `PhaseFinalised(uint256 phase, uint256 amount);`

---

##### Terminate Market
This function is conditional, if the market has successfully finished (the previous rounds funding's state is `ENDED` and the next phases state is `NOT_STARTED`) then the function sends the Molecule vault it's tax and the creator their remaining collateral. If this condition is not met (the market has failed) then the remaining funds are sent to the market.
Either way the market is finalized.
The event is only emitted if the fundraiser successfully finished
```
function terminateMarket() external;
```
emits `FundingWithdrawn(uint256 phase, uint256 amount);`
