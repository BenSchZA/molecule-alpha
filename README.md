# Molecule Catalyst

The Molecule Alpha implementation focuses on giving no strings attached funding to small research initiatives. This is done by gamifying the crowdfunding aspect by using bonding curves and a taxation on buy.

Tokens issued via the bonding curve give no rights over the research, and all DAI sent to the bonding curve contract are a donation, with the added benefit that tokens minted for this DAI can be sold along the same curve for potential profit.

The fundraising amount is entirely kept separate, as each buy is taxed and the tax is kept in a vault which can be withdrawn from if the fundraising milestone has been reached.

---

# How a funding campaign works

- A researcher will fill out project specifics, detailing what the funding milestones are in dollar amounts and what the funds will be used for.
- The Molecule Admin will vet this project proposal, and if approved, the Bonding Curve and Vault contracts will be created.
- Any user can deposit DAI into the bonding curve contract, which will mint bonded tokens along the bonding curve line. A tax will be applied to this transaction, and deducted from the amount of bonded tokens they receive. The taxed amount in DAI is sent to a vault contract.
- Any user with bonded tokens can send bonded tokens to the bonding curve contract, which will be burnt along the bonding curve line, send them DAI in exchange.
- Once the a funding milestone has been reached, the researcher can withdraw this amount into their wallet.

# Implementation

Our initial bonding curve implementation supports linear and Bancor-based curves, dividend distributions for bonded token holders, and a front-running guard via user-specified min and max prices.

## Key Terms

- **bondingCurve**: Contract that holds the curve functionality and token holders amounts of bondedTokens, with automated market maker, tax and distribute functions.
- **vault**: The contract which holds the tax from the bondingCurve. This can be withdrawn by the researcher.
- **moleculeVault**: The contract which holds the tax which is taken off the successfully funded vault. This can be withdrawn by the administrator.
- **bondedToken**: Token native to the curve. The bondingCurve contract has exclusive rights to mint and burn tokens.
- **collateralToken**: Token accepted as collateral by the curve. (e.g.Â DAI)
- **sellCollateral**: Balance of collateralTokens that the curve holds. The reserve is used to pay bondedToken holders when they want to liquidate and sell their tokens back to the curve.

## Project Life Cycle 

Below is a simplified flow of the contract life cycle. In this section we will go through the life cycle of a project on Molecule Catalyst. 

<div align="center">
    <img src="./Blockchain/x-imgs/molCat_lifecycle.png">
</div>

1. The project life cycle starts outside the contracts with the submission of a project to the Molecule Catalyst team. The team reviews applications to ensure only the higheset quality projects make it onto the system. 
2. If the Molecule Catalyst team approves the project, it then gets entered into the contract architecture. The project and its details are formatted and a transaction (`deployMarket()`) is made with the `MarketFactory`. 
3. The `MarketFactory` will then deploy a `Market` and a `Vault` and link them. The linking of the `Vault` and `Market` allows for communication between the two, and the transferring of funds from the `Market` to the `Vault`, and checks enforced from the `Vault` to the `Market`. 
4. The `MarketFactory` also sends the details of the `Vault` and `Market` to the `MarketRegistry`. This means that `MarketFactory`s can be updated and changed without loosing existing market systems. 
5. Whenever a user buys tokens in the `Market`, a portion of the funding is sent to the `Vault`. The portion is determined by the `_taxationRate`. When the `mint()` function executes in the `Market`, the `validateFunding()` function is called on the `Vault`. This function ensures that the rounds is still valid (has not expired), that the round has not ended and that all the rounds have not been finished. 
6. When a milestone (`_fundingGoal`) has been reached, the project creator will then gain access to that funding. The creator can call the `withdraw()` function on the `Vault` and receive a successful rounds funding. The creator can only withdraw a rounds funding when that rounds funding threshold has been reached.

Anytime throughout the projects life cycle the creator can call the `terminateMarket()` function, and end the fund rasing. This function will not result in them loosing any rounds of funding that where already filled, but it will prevent the market from minting new tokens, and wil cause the market to terminate. The `Market`s termination means that users can no longer buy or sell tokens. They can `withdraw()` funding from the market, exchanging tokens they have for collateral in the market.

# Project Details

The project is built using our [full-stack boilerplate](https://gitlab.com/linumlabs/ethers-react-redux-typescript-mongo-boilerplate).
This boilerplate provides a framework with the following features:

* Database: MongoDb
* API Server: NestJS
* Web App: React + Redux
 
## System Requirements

* NodeJS = 10.6.0
* Yarn >= 1.0
* MongoDB instance

## Getting Started

The stack is configured as a monorepo. After configuring the various components & environment variables, the project can be spun up from the root.

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Run `yarn` in the project root to install all dependencies

### Configuring The Repo

In a terminal: 
1. Go to the Molecule Alpha root project directory
2. Run ```cd ApiServer```
3. Run ```cp .env.example .env``` - this is where you will configure all environment variables
4. Input the various required information from the folders ```.env.example```.
5. Repeate steps 1 through 4 in the `WebApp` folder, and if you want to run the contracts yourself, the `Blockchain` folder.

### Starting Application

After configuring the `ApiServer`, `WebApp`, and `Blockchain` following the steps below, run `yarn start:dev` from the root to spin up all the necessary components.

# Contracts Deployment

A unique database is created for each deployment. For example `MONGO_DATABASE: "molecule-catalyst-$NAMESPACE-$NPM_CONTRACTS_VERSION"`.

## Rinkeby

For testing against the Rinkeby testnet, add the above environment variables to your WebApp `.env` file.

The latest Rinkeby test net deployment as of 11-11-2019

```
NPM package: `"@molecule-protocol/catalyst-contracts": "0.0.14"`
```
